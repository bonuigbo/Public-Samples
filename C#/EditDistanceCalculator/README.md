C#: Edit Distance calculator
==============

Given two words, this program generates a matrix that calculates the edit distance
between the words. The edit distance is a number which represents how similar
or different two words are - the lower the number, the more identical the words
are. This calculation is used alot in Bioinformatics, and in particular, genetics.
