# C# : Classifier Program

This was a school project. The goal was to analyze customer buying habits
from a large company in order to determine if that customer or client
would be likely to buy or sell the company's product during the next business
cycle.

The program used three different classifiers as a comparison of the different
methodologies involved with each, and is designed to take in a particular
format of input data.
