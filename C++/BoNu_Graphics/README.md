C++ Samples
==============

The code plays around alot with DirectX, especially with respect to optimizing
buffer space, memory management, and allocating/deallocating resources.
It also was my experimentation using Matrix transformations to animate block
characters. A rudimentary engine that I will soon have time to flourish now that
I'm out of school.
